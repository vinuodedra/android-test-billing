Android Market In-app Billing is an Android Market service that lets you sell digital content in your applications.

The real API can't be tested in the emulator, because it requires the latest Android Market application or the [MyApps](http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=190860) application, which don't exist on the emulator.

The aim of this project is to provide a framework for testing Android Market In-app Billing API usage in your application on the emulator without having to do the setup to use the real API.
