#summary Official documentation mistakes

= Official documentation mistakes =

Official documentation contains several inconsistencies, which can be resolved by looking at the provided example code.

  # NOTIFY_IDS parameter is the array of strings
  # The inapp_signed_data JSON in the PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED notification has the array of orders. Also the array sometimes is not present at all, so they use JSONObject.optJSONArray() to parse it.

The correct inapp_signed_data JSON example would be like this :

<code language="json">
{ "nonce" : 1836535032137741465,
  "orders" : [
    { "notificationId" : "android.test.purchased",
      "orderId" : "transactionId.android.test.purchased",
      "packageName" : "com.example.dungeons",
      "productId" : "android.test.purchased",
      "developerPayload" : "bGoa+V7g/yqDXvKRqq+JTFn4uQZbPiQJo4pf9RzJ",
      "purchaseTime" : 1290114783411,
      "purchaseState" : 0 }]
}
