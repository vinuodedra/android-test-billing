== 1. Reference the library ==
You have 2 options : reference the source code or reference the jar library.

The simplest is to reference the jar :
  * Download the latest distribution package from http://code.google.com/p/android-test-billing/downloads/list and copy it to your "lib" directory
  * Reference the jar in your Eclipse project (Project menu -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add JARs...)

If you want to be able to debug, it's better to reference android-test-billing source code. Follow the instructions http://code.google.com/p/android-test-billing/source/checkout to download the code.
  * Checkout the code to your Eclipse workspace directory.
  * Add a reference from your main project (Project menu -> Properties -> Android -> Library -> Add)
