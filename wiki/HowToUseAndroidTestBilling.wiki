= How to setup Android Test Billing in your project =

  # Reference the library
  # Edit AndroidManifest.xml
  # Create the test service object
  # Add the test code

== 1. Reference the library ==
You have 2 options : reference the source code or reference the jar library.

The simplest is to reference the jar :
  * Download the latest distribution package from [http://code.google.com/p/android-test-billing/downloads/list Downloads] and copy it to your "lib" directory
  * Reference the jar in your Eclipse project (Project menu -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add JARs...)

If you want to be able to debug, it's better to reference android-test-billing source code. Follow the instructions [http://code.google.com/p/android-test-billing/source/checkout Source code] to download the code.
  * Checkout the code to your Eclipse workspace directory.
  * Add a reference from your main project (Project menu -> Properties -> Android -> Library -> Add)

== 2. Edit AndroidManifest.xml ==
Add the following to AndroidManifest.xml :
<code language="xml">
{{{
        <activity android:name="com.android.vending.billing.test.TestPaymentScreenActivity" />
}}}
</code>
This registers the test payment screen.

== 3. Create the test service object ==
As simple as :
<code language="java">
{{{
	private IMarketBillingService createMarketBillingService() {
		return new com.android.vending.billing.test.TestMarketBillingService(this);
	}
}}}
</code>

== 4. Add the test code ==
Add the test code as described in the documentation ([http://developer.android.com/guide/market/billing/billing_integrate.html Implementing In-app Billing]). You will need to create :
  * a payment Activity (the screen where you select what to buy and proceed to the checkout)
  * a BroadcastReceiver (it receives the notifications from the Android Market application)
  * and a Service, which connects BroadcastReceiver and the payment Activity

Don't add AIDL file to your project.
